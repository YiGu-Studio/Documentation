# MBSubModuleBase

You can inherit from the MBSubModuleBase class to handle the loading of your module, it is essentially the entry point to your code. There are several useful overrides, such as `OnSubModuleLoad()` and `OnApplicationTick()` that you can make use of.

**It is important to note that you must reference the class' fully qualified name in the module's `SubModule.xml` for this to work properly.**

Example `SubModule.xml` where `ExampleMod.MySubModule` is the fully qualified name for the class inheriting MBSubModuleBase: [SubModule.xml](../../_xmldocs/submodule.md)

## Overrides

This is the full list of available overrides, in \(generally\) the order in which they are called. This is a rough guide and is not a substitute for debugging when you're having order-of-execution issues.

* `OnSubModuleLoad()` - Called during the first loading screen of the game, always the first override to be called, this is where you should be doing the bulk of your initial setup.
* `OnApplicationTick(float)` - This is called once every frame, you should avoid expensive operations being called directly here and instead do as little work as possible for performance reasons. 
  * `float` - The time in milliseconds the frame took to complete.
* `OnBeforeInitialModuleScreenSetAsRoot()` - Called just before the main menu first appears, helpful if your mod depends on other things being set up during the initial load.
* `OnGameStart(Game, IGameStarter)` - Called immediately upon loading after selecting a game mode \(submodule\) from the main menu.
  * `Game` - [See: Game](https://github.com/YiGu-Studio/Documentation/tree/7efd9f45ae67eda919d26b06b2b4f76b6cefcb12/_csharp-api/core/game.md)
  * `IGameStarter` - N/A
