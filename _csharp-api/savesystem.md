# Save System

### Warning!

As of e1.0.10/e1.1.0 when defining custom data that inherits the game's basic types, be extra careful.  
If the data will be saved to the game's internal storage, upon removing your mod the save won't be able to load because of your missing custom data.  
This will be the case when definining custom `LogEntry` types and passing them to the game \(`LogEntry.AddLogEntry(customLog);`.  
As a workaround, you should either include a feature to fully remove your custom data from the game or provide a mod for it.

## SaveableTypeDefiner

For defining custom classes and structs, implement your own `TaleWorlds.SaveSystem.SaveableTypeDefiner`.  
You don't need to register it somewhere, the game will find it itself via reflection.

```csharp
    public class CustomSaveDefiner : SaveableTypeDefiner
    {
        // use a big number and ensure that no other mod is using a close range
        public CustomSaveDefiner() : base(2 _333_000) { }

        protected override void DefineClassTypes()
        {
            // The Id's here are local and will be related to the Id passed to the constructor
            AddClassDefinition(typeof(CustomMapNotification), 1);
            AddStructDefinition(typeof(ExampleStruct), 2);
            AddClassDefinition(typeof(ExampleNested), 3);
            AddStructDefinition(typeof(NestedStruct), 4);
        }

        protected override void DefineContainerDefinitions()
        {
            ConstructContainerDefinition(typeof(List<ExampleStruct>));
        }
    }
```

## SaveableField and SaveableProperty

To mark data in your custom class/struct as savable, use `TaleWorlds.SaveSystem.SaveableFieldAttribute` and `TaleWorlds.SaveSystem.SaveablePropertyAttribute`.  
It seems that there is noreal difference between `SaveableField` and `SaveableProperty`, but if you used one of them, stick to the type. They are not interchangeable and the data won't be loaded if types awe swicthed.

```csharp
    public struct ExampleStruct
    {
        // Local ID's start from one if the class/struct does not inherit from any
        // game's types with saveable data
        [SaveableField(1)]
        public PartyBase Attacker;
    }

    public class CustomMapNotification : InformationData
    {
        // InformationData already contains 5 definitions, so start from 6 for custom data
        [SaveableProperty(6)]
        public Hero Mercenary { get; set; }

        [SaveableProperty(7)]
        public bool IsHandled { get; set; }
    }

    public struct NestedStruct
    {
        [SaveableField(1)]
        public bool Flag;
    }
    public class ExampleNested
    {
        [SaveableField(1)]
        public NestedStruct Data;
    }
```

## CampaignBehaviorBase.SyncData

There is also "shared data" that could be used between one/miltiple `CampaignBehaviorBase`.  
With it you can store custom container data, such as:

* Array
* List
* Dictionary
* Queue

  ```csharp
    public class CustomBehavior : CampaignBehaviorBase
    {
        private List<ExampleStruct> _customDataMap = new List<ExampleStruct>();

        public override void SyncData(IDataStore dataStore)
        {
            dataStore.SyncData("customDataMap", ref _customDataMap);
        }
    }
  ```

### Notes:

The community should decide how to handle `saveBaseId` collisions.
